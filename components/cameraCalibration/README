This is a tutorial on getting the camera calibration from OpenCV for 
a given camera.

First, get the code. It is stored in the OpenCV source at 
samples/cpp/tutorial_code/calib3d/camera_calibration/ or you can 
get it from this website: 
<http://docs.opencv.org/_downloads/camera_calibration.cpp>. 
Compile it with this command:
g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` camera_calibration.cpp

Run the calibration program: <binary> <calibration_input.xml>

Now, you use the XML configuration files included in this directory. 
First, create a set of test images using a flat checkerboard from 
a variety of distances and angles. If you put these files into a 
directory, you can use the buildlist.sh script to create a valid calim.xml
file. This file is basically a list of files you want to use. For best
results, you should use a checkerboard with a lot of checkers but not
too many. A 9x6 checkerboard (measured as internal checkers or where black
squares meet black squares) worked well. Be sure the checkerboard
is taped down securely to a flat surface.

After creating the list of images you wish to use, you need to 
work on in_calim.xml. This file gives the parameters to the actual program.
Fill in the number of internal checkers (defined above). The square size
is arbitrary but I used millimeters in our application. Number of frames
is the only other really important parameter in this file. This tells
the calibration to use this number of images MAX in the calibration. 

In order to get an accurate calibration, you must use at least a dozen images
(meaning that OpenCV sees at least a dozen frames with a checkerboard).
For example, a 0.3% reprojection error was projected when using an 80 image
subset of a 500 image capture. As of 8/5/2013, this file is used as the
calibration for the mvBlueFOX camera on the quadrotor with the 2.8mm
wide-angle lens. Time is also a factor in calibration. On a 5-year-old
dual-core computer, the calibration using 80 images took at least an hour.
Using 200 and 220 images for calibration took 3 and 3.5 hours respectively
on that machine but produced greater reprojection error. 

Good luck.

Now, an expanded version of these instructions can be found on the OpenCV
website: <http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/calib3d/camera_calibration/camera_calibration.html>.
