This directory contains code to embed spread IPC
into Matlab:

spreadAPI.mexglx: Mex file containing low-level calls to spread API.
	Typically should not be called directly

spreadAPIConnect(proc_name,...)
spreadAPIJoin(group)
spreadAPIMulticastReliable(group, data)
spreadAPIMulticastFIFO(group, data)
spreadAPIMulticastCausal(group, data)
spreadAPIReceive


To start spread, make sure spread.conf is properly configured.
Then start daemon:
spread -n localhost

To manually interact with spread from command line:
spuser -s 4803 (with appropriate port number in spread.conf)


Example using Matlab calls is in test_spread.m

To serialize/deserialize Matlab variables into uint8 arrays,
s = serialize(x);
x = deserialize(s);
