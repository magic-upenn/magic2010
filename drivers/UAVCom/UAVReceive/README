This directory contains several key components of the visual-servoing
of our quadrotor. Here are the important things to note:

quadDataPublish:
When run on the local machine (most likely the MAGIC robot), this program
makes sure that data transmitted from the quadrotor is published to IPC.
Once on IPC, all of the processing and servoing functions can access data. Before running this program, be sure that the startCentral.sh script (in scripts/) has been started.

apriltags:
This program detects if an apriltag is visible in the quadrotor camera. If so,
certain characteristics such as the six degrees of freedom and distance are
output for the user. 

out_qc_data.xml:
This is a configuration file for the constant factors in the quadrotor
camera as well as in the AprilTags used. For instance, the size of the image
caputred by the quadrotor is given to apriltags based on this configuration
file. This file was originally generated by OpenCV's camera calibration tools.
See their website for more information on how to perform this. Also, the 
apriltag_Width field must be added manually to the file after any
new calibration.
