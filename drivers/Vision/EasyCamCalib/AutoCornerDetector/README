AutoCorner Detector.

This set of functions automatically detect and count the squares of a calibration grid, returning the coordinates of the corner points in the image and in the coordinates plane.
                                        
KNOWN ISSUES:
- Sometimes 2 point get assigned to the save corner
- Some "corner count" failures can happen when the calibration plane is to inclined
- Sometimes autocorners are assigned in the middle of a black square (some minor bug i think)
- Still some improvements to be made in the corner coordinates counter
